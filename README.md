# FUTURE_CS_01
Implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

# 2FA Authentication

This application showcases two-factor authentication (2FA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) and QR codes. It enables users to register, log in, and enhance account security through TOTP-based 2FA.

## Features

-> Implements user registration with secure username and password creation.
-> Facilitates user login through password authentication.
-> Enhances security with two-factor authentication (2FA) utilizing Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP).
-> Generates QR codes for seamless 2FA setup and integration.

## Prerequisites

-> Python 3.6 or later
-> Flask framework
-> pyotp library for TOTP
-> qrcode library for QR code generation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CTFxShubh/FUTURE_CS_01.git
   cd FUTURE_CS_01
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install Flask pyotp qrcode
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser and navigate to:**

   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` - Home page
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register` - Register a new user
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login` - Log in
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/2fa` - Two-factor authentication

## How It Works

1. **Registration:**
   - Users register with a username and password.
   - A TOTP secret is generated for the user and stored in memory.

2. **Login:**
   - Users log in with their username and password.
   - If the credentials are correct, they are redirected to the 2FA page.

3. **Two-Factor Authentication:**
   - Users enter the OTP generated by their authenticator app.
   - The application verifies the OTP against the stored TOTP secret.

4. **QR Code Generation:**
   - A QR code is generated and displayed for the user to scan with their authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).

## Notes

- The application uses an in-memory dictionary (`users`) to store user data. For production use, consider using a database.
- The `secret_key` is used for session management. Change it to a more secure key in a real application.
- Ensure that your application is secure and handle sensitive information appropriately.
